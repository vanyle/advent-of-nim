=== PROBLEM STATEMENT ====
--- Part Two ---

You climb over weather machines, under giant springs, and narrowly avoid a pile of pipes as you find and disconnect the three wires.
A moment after you disconnect the last wire, the big red reset button module makes a small ding noise:
```System overload resolved!
Power required is now 50 stars* .
```
Out of the corner of your eye, you notice goggles and a loose-fitting hard hat peeking at you from behind an ultra crucible. You think you see a faint glow, but before you can investigate, you hear another small ding:
```Power required is now 49 stars* .

Please supply the necessary stars and
push the button to restart the system.
```
