=== PROBLEM STATEMENT ====
--- Part Two ---

Everyone will starve if you only plant such a small number of seeds. Re-reading the almanac, it looks like the `seeds:`line actually describes *ranges of seed numbers* .
The values on the initial `seeds:`line come in pairs. Within each pair, the first value is the *start* of the range and the second value is the *length* of the range. So, in the first line of the example above:
```seeds: 79 14 55 13```
This line describes two ranges of seed numbers to be planted in the garden. The first range starts with seed number `79`and contains `14`values: `79`, `80`, ..., `91`, `92`. The second range starts with seed number `55`and contains `13`values: `55`, `56`, ..., `66`, `67`.
Now, rather than considering four seed numbers, you need to consider a total of *27* seed numbers.
In the above example, the lowest location number can be obtained from seed number `82`, which corresponds to soil `84`, fertilizer `84`, water `84`, light `77`, temperature `45`, humidity `46`, and *location `46`* . So, the lowest location number is `*46* `.
Consider all of the initial seed numbers listed in the ranges on the first line of the almanac. *What is the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers?*
