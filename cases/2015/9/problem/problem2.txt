=== PROBLEM STATEMENT ====
--- Part Two ---

The next year, just to show off, Santa decides to take the route with the *longest distance* instead.
He can still start and end at any two (different) locations he wants, and he still must visit each location exactly once.
For example, given the distances above, the longest route would be ```982```via (for example) ```Dublin -> London -> Belfast```.
What is the distance of the longest route?

Add your test cases below. You can add multiple cases if you need
=== ADVENTOFCODE CASE ===
London to Dublin = 464
London to Belfast = 518
Dublin to Belfast = 141
=== ADVENTOFCODE SOLUTION ===
