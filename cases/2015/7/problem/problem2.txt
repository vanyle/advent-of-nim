Now, take the signal you got on wire ```a```, override wire ```b```to that signal, and reset the other wires (including wire ```a```).  What new signal is ultimately provided to wire ```a```?

Add your test cases below. You can add multiple cases if you need
=== ADVENTOFCODE CASE ===
123 -> x
456 -> y
x AND y -> d
x OR y -> e
x LSHIFT 2 -> a
y RSHIFT 2 -> b
NOT x -> h
NOT y -> i
